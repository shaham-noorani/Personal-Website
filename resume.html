      Through my journey as a software engineer, I've been able to intern at 4
      software companies: Threatcare (now
      <a href="https://www.reliaquest.com" target="_blank">ReliaQuest</a>),
      <a href="https://iodinesoftware.com" target="_blank">Iodine Software</a>,
      <a href="https://www.jbhunt.com" target="_blank">J. B. Hunt</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.dialexa.com" target="_blank">Dialexa</a>. I also
      co-founded a company in 2022 called I-Trial.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm most familiar with web-technologies like Angular, React, and Vue,
      working mainly with Typescript. In terms of backends, I've worked with
      Express and .Net Core, and I'm well versed in relational and
      non-relational databases. I've architected many systems and enjoy
      evaulating technologies for a project and establishing patterns.
      <br />
      <br />
      I thrive in fast paced environments where I'm wearing many hats (software
      engineering, product management, project management, software
      architecture, etc.). I also excel in teamwork and communication. The
      industries that I'm most passionate about are education, productivity, and
      organization efficiency. But no matter the domain, I'm driven by
      determining and trying to solve problems that users' face—in environments
      where I can learn and grow.
      <br />
      <br />
      Finally, I always strive to give back to the community. I worked at a
      charity software company in highschool called
      <a href="https://www.auctionsourcemobile.com" target="_blank"
        >AuctionSource</a
      >
      where I assisted non-profits in raising hundreds of thousands in
      philanthropy. I've also worked as a coding instructor at a company called
      <a href="https://www.thecodegalaxy.com" target="_blank">Code Galaxy</a>,
      helping students K-12 learn Scratch, Python, Web Development, and Unity.
